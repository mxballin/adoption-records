Home Economics & health ends in Gr. 10. Grades 11 and 12 will not have to take health unless they wish to get some credits and take it with some lower grades. It certainly is a crazy way, don’t you think, Joan? I get 11 study periods a week and that’s monotenous [sic] so I wanted to take more credits, but the principle (Mr. Jacobs.) said 30 credits is enough for a late-commer [sic] so I’m still carrying 30 credits.

Trying to study a year’s work in six or seven hours is quite difficult for me. (of course, it would not be so with you.) When the next morning came, my mind was a complete blank.
