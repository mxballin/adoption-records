<p>The following is information about my interview protocol and procedures of care that I have built into my interview process in order to ensure that subjects feel comfortable and empowered throughout their involvement in the project.</p>

<h2>Participation Structure</h2>

<h4>Interviews</h4>

<p>Participants will be interviewed in a semi-structured manner, with the focus being on how they tell their adoption 'story,' how they construct their cultural and racial identity/ies, and where records fit into that narrative.</p>

<h4>Object Elicitation</h4>

<p>In addition to interview questions, there will also be an object elicitation activity that the participants will be asked to engage with. This will involve their selection of 2-5 documents relating to their adoption that they feel strongly speak to their story, the questions they have about their adoption, and/or the relationships that they have built through, alongside, or in some cases in spite of their adoption. During their interview, participants will be asked to share about these documents and why they chose them for the prompt.</p>

<h4>Literature Response</h4>

<p>Alongside a fairly large body of adoption research and scholarship, there is also a significant amount of creative nonfiction and fiction that centres the adoptee experience. Some of these works explicitly focus on the presence and absense of records, notably the poetry and writings of Sun Yun Shin and the graphic novel, <i>Palimpsest</i> by Lisa Wool-Rim Sj√∂blom</p>
<p>In this element of the interview process, participants will be asked to respond to excerpts from these two authors and voice the similarities or differences of their experiences and thoughts.</p>

<h2>Recording of Consent</h2>
<p>Carter, et al. (2021) note that the recording of consent in the context of online research can lead to varying challenges due to the process being entirely virtual. Following their arguments that written consent formats can be complicating, restrictive, and potentially introduce security concerns, the format for seeking and recording consent for this study will be done verbally.</p>

<h4>Process</h4>
In order to limit the number of meetings required of participants, recording of consent will by default occur at the start of the first scheduled interview session.  However, if it is the preference of the participant to have a separate introductory session that will allow for real-time addressal of questions and concerns, this option will be made available to them.
