When Japanese Canadians were forcibly displaced, they not only were forcibly removed from their homes, but also restricted in their ability to gain and distribute information.

Access to radios and cameras in particular was severely limited, often completely denied to uprooted Nikkei. Order In Council 1486 explicitly permitted the confiscation of short-wave radios and cameras by the RCMP, ostensibly because of concerns that Japanese Canadians would be using these sources of information for the benefit of Japan.

It is not entirely clear in the context of these letters as to whether or not Japanese Canadians were explicitly told they were not allowed to have these materials.

In one letter, Tad Nagamori writes, “Oh yes we got a privilege to own a radio and a camera here. We had both radio and two cameras there but we had to leave it in the hands of the R.C.M.P. I believe the custodian is now looking after it. That radio wouldn’t be in any use here I don’t think because the dials are different here We have sent for our camera about two weeks ago but it still hasn’t arrived”

Sumi Mototsune also communicates an awareness of the looming restrictions on the use of cameras, noting in one letter to Joan that “Were [sic] still allowed to have a camera yet, but since we haven’t one, we’ll have to borrow someones. We’re intending to take pictures before our cameras get banned, if they ever do. “

Having the ability to do something and yet not having the access or means to actually be able to do it is a recurrent theme throughout the letters. Just as Sumi's family wanted take more pictures if they could, many of the teens would have progressed much further in their education if they could, and many families tried to submit requests to move to new farms but were denied (Ketchell 2005, 6). Tad's family waiting to receive their camera, but never actually getting it from the "custodian" of their property is also reflective of the conflicting messages of freedoms and restrictions that Japanese Canadians experienced throughout this period.

There is a theme across a large array of experiences from Japanese Canadians’ forced dispersal that relates to this idea of not quite being denied something, but also not actually being able to do something as a result of the measures and stigma associated with the Nikkei community during the period fo forced dispersal. A lack of money, a lack of agency, and a lack of resources played heavily into the quality of life that these families were able to have.

### Photographs

While their access to picture-making equipment may have been limited or outright denied, photographs are clearly incredibly important to the letter writers, as evidenced by their many requests that Joan send them photos of herself or of home.

"I will be very grateful to you if you can spare some few to me" Sumi asked of Joan. She later remarked, “I love pictures and I could look at them all everyday without getting a bit fed up. That’s how much I like them.”

Albert and Tad never failed to request in their letters that Joan send photos of herself to them.

Photographs from before their forced removal offered an important way for Nikkei to remain connected with their pasts, and also to continue to foster a type of visual knowledge of changes to places and people that they missed.

> Art historian Namiko Kunimoto writes, “As Japanese Canadians were uprooted from familiar communities throughout British Columbia and were overwhelmed by the loss of loved ones, photography was a way to re-centre themselves within a seemingly stable, yet imaginary, network of relations. Looking became an act of exchange with the subject – conflating the act of seeing with the act of knowing. At a time when all else familiar had been lost, photographs were the internee's ‘most cherished possession’.”

When they could, the letter writers also sent photos in return.

When they did not have access to their own camera, traveling photographers offered a way for folks to have their photos taken.

Sumi wrote: “A man from the Lethbridge studio came over to Raymond and established a little room to take pictures. I think he’s going back to Lethbridge this Saturday. He is quick in developing pictures so lot [sic] of people get their pictures taken. Usually, he has them develop-ed the next day.”

### Letter Writing

The visual communication of photographs and photograph exchange was made possible by the central activity that this exhibit celebrates: letter writing.

Just as photographs could provide visual reminders of home, letters from Joan represented one of the only sources of news from home available. Even if they could have had better access to media such as the radio or newspapers, several of the letter writers noted that it would be of little use because it would only be news of their present location.

Sumi wrote, “We don’t get any newspaper so we don’t know anything. Whenever Dad goes to town, he buys a “Lethbridge Herald News” paper. It has only the half of the pages from that of Sun or Province, and there is no news of Vancouver or New Westminster. The other day, I sent a letter to “The Vancouver Daily Provinces” asking them if they can send a newspaper over here to Raymond. Do you think they will?”

The news that Joan was able to provide in her letters was precious.
Sumi describes her eagerness in receiving them: I recognized your writing on the envelope and ripped it open & read it immediately. The way how I threw down my hoe to read it, my mother knew who the letter was from. I read your letters, I don’t know how many times.

Postscripts asking for her to write as soon as she could are common throughout the letters. As are descriptions of how her letters were able to give them a slice of the life they were missing.

Albert: You know, three weeks after Christmas Eve, when I got your letter, I spent it all over again -- in your house! Boy it was swell! https://ubc-library-rbsc.github.io/gillis-2021_ohd/transcripts/ohama.html#ohama112

But while Joan was able to provide many tales of Queen Elizabeth High School and what it was like at home in New Westminster, neither her letters nor those of the letter writers were free from the scrutiny of the Canadian government.

###### Censorship

In addition to restrictions on certain forms of communication and information exchange, letters written to and by Japanese Canadians were subject to censure beginning in March of 1942. This process, in combination with the relative remoteness of many of the farms or towns that forcibly displaced families were sent to, greatly impacted how frequently letters could be sent and received.

Tad remarks to Joan: “Every letter we’re getting now is cencored [sic] and just to send a letter 30 miles it takes over a week, because every letter we write goes back to B.C. to be cencored [sic].”

Of the letters from the Gillis fonds that are included in this exhibit, none of them were expressly censured by those that read them. It is possible that, through trial and error, the letter writers knew what not to include, or perhaps it is that there was much less concern on the part of the censor regarding what information about the conditions Japanese Canadians were living in was getting out to a white teenager in B.C. Either way, despite the fact that there are no marks of censorship on the letters, traces of their having read the letters remain in the form of stamps on the envelopes confirming their passing inspection.

We also do see traces of censorship activity in the content of the letters themselves. While the information going to Joan may not have been censored, it appears that many of the letters that she sent to her friends were.

It is possible that information about the peat plant that Joan was working at was censored for this reason." objectid="gillis007" width="75" centered=true %}
