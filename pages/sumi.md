Certainly, I’m going to bring home some “Raymond Sugar” to you. I don’t know if they’re the finest and sweetest sugar in the world, but at least, they taste like sugar. Every sugar we buy in bags or sacks, it has “Raymond, Alberta” written on it. Imagine, a small country-like town of Raymond written on sugar bags! Someday, it’s going to make a history of the largest sugar producing factory in Canada. Day after day, you do the same work and it seems like ages until you get accustomed to the long monotony of working in the beet-fields.</div>

We went on the 2nd, because it was said that too many people always attend on the 1st that you couldn’t hardly see the performances. Lucky for us that we did! and it was a wonder that both days were fine. There were many different performances such as bucking, steer decorating, calf roping, horses, etc.. . A cowboy was sent to the Lethbridge hospital because he got kicked or stepped on or something by the horse. (P.S. there is no hospital in Raymond.)</div>

She didn’t know anything about it, and when she unzipped it during the period (study period.) the snake just sprung at her & was she frightened! Poor girl, & she just can’t stand snakes. This isn’t the only incident that has happened. I saw a snake coiled on the banister and several times live snakes wandering in the rooms. Especially the Grade X room because its [sic] only the Grade X boys who would think of doing it. Well, I’m glad as the principle gave a lecture on such a behavior.

Well, this is our Raymond High School as they call it. Just now, we’re having a four day Easter holiday. 23rd, 24th, 25th & 26th. This is only for the High School; the public school got off from 23rd to May 3rd, lucky things. The school van is still running, thank goodness. We were going to get a 2 ½ hour Easter exam (for each subject I mean) before the holiday but the teachers decided not to give it this year as we’re fairly behind in our school work. We’re all looking forward to the June Exam!!</div>

In Lethbridge or Raymond, I went all over the shoe stores asking for girls’ white running shoes, but they don’t have anymore in stock.
