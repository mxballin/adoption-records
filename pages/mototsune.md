I recognized your writing on the envelope and ripped it open & read it immediately. The way how I threw down my hoe to read it, my mother knew who the letter was from. I read your letters, I don’t know how many times. Next day, I happened to look in the envelope and the first letter was dated (or stamped) May 1, while the second, May 8. I don’t know how it happened, but I suppose it was because we haven’t been to town for ages.</div>

I got several bruises, but not as bad as what yours was. I tried to get up, but I couldn’t for a minute. Then a car comes along towards heading my way, and somehow I managed to get up and drag the bike to one side of the road. A young man was in the car and he asked if I hurt myself badly. I just said I only got a few bruises which was nothing at all. I haven’t seen him since.</div>

On the morning of the 1st there was a parade with fire-crackers going off. Imagine, fire-crackers on Dominion Day!! It seems funny to us, but I guess its [sic] their custom. We went on the 2nd, because it was said that too many people always attend on the 1st that you couldn’t hardly see the performances. Lucky for us that we did! and it was a wonder that both days were fine. There were many different performances such as bucking, steer decorating, calf roping, horses, etc.. . A cowboy was sent to the Lethbridge hospital because he got kicked or stepped on or something by the horse. (P.S. there is no hospital in Raymond.)</div>

Home Economics & health ends in Gr. 10. Grades 11 and 12 will not have to take health unless they wish to get some credits and take it with some lower grades. It certainly is a crazy way, don’t you think, Joan? I get 11 study periods a week and that’s monotenous [sic] so I wanted to take more credits, but the principle (Mr. Jacobs.) said 30 credits is enough for a late-commer [sic] so I’m still carrying 30 credits.

Trying to study a year’s work in six or seven hours is quite difficult for me. (of course, it would not be so with you.) When the next morning came, my mind was a complete blank.
