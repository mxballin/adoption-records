We are currently in the recruitment phase of the study!

As this study is for a Master's thesis, there are limits to its scope and we are unfortunately not able to include the incredible diversity of adoptee voices that we know are out there and would love to engage with. We are specifically looking for English-speaking Chinese & Korean transracial, transnational adoptees to participate.

For information about what you would be asked to do as a participant, check out the <a href="https://adoption-records.mxballin.com/protocol.html">interview protocol page</a>.

If you are interested in participating, please email Mya Ballin at <a href="mailto:mya.ballin@ubc.ca">mya.ballin@ubc.ca</a>.
