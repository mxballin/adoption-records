We are currently in the recruitment phase of the study.

As this study is for a Master's thesis, there are limits to its scope. We are specifically looking for English-speaking Chinese & Korean transracial adoptees to participate.

If you decide to participate, your involvement would consist of
[INSERT INTERVIEW INFO] where you will be asked to share about
your adoption, your sense of cultural and racial identity/identities, your knowledge of records related to your adoption, and if and how you have interacted with or created records of this nature.
