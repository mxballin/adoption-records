## Homesickness

Only just over a month passed between the declaration of war on Japan by Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King, and the Order in Council that began to strip Japanese Canadians of their homes, livelihoods, and property. By spring of 1942, most families were already being sent against their will to various internment sites and sugar beet farms across the country.

Because of how quickly this uprooting took place, we can see in the correspondentsâ€™ earliest letters with Joan their individual ways of coping with the loss of their homes, their communities, and their safety.

Many correspondents expressed a great longing for British Columbia; for most of them, New Westminster and the areas surrounding it were the only home they had ever known. Weather comparisons and romantic descriptions of West Coast landscapes can be found in a number of the letters.
