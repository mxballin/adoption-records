## Sugar Beet Farms

<p style="text-indent: 25px;"> Much of the work done by the families of the correspondents centres around sugar beet farming. The “option” to work on sugar beet farms provided an important opportunity for Japanese Canadian families to experience their forced removal from B.C. together rather than apart--options such as work camps were highly gendered in nature and led to the separation of men from women and children. According to scholars, this benefit of togetherness-in-forced-dispersal was something that was highly emphasized by the Canadian government when the sugar beet farming was presented to families <sup>1</sup></p>
<p style="text-indent: 25px;"> Once they had agreed to the work and arrived in Alberta and Manitoba, Japanese Canadian families were met with incredibly poor living conditions, very little pay, and weather that dramatically affected their ability to work. However, although in some instances they had been promised relative freedom of movement, Shelley Ketchell notes, “it is clear that once they committed to the program, the choices were no longer their own. Choices, instead, became dictated by negotiations between the [British Columbia Security Commission] and towns and cities in Alberta and Manitoba”<sup>2</sup> </p>

{% include feature/card.html header="Why Sugar Beets?" text="Sugar beets are high in sucrose and are commonly used in Canada and the United States for the production of white sugar. In Canada, sugar beets are particularly valuable because Canada does not have the right climate to grow sugar cane, the other most common source of raw material for sugar. Sugar beets continue to be key to the production of sugar in Canada -- in 2006, Statistics Canada estimated that farmers in Alberta produced 963,000 tonnes of sugar beets that went on to become 124,000 tonnes of beet sugar<sup>3</sup>; in 2018, 1.38 million tonnes of sugar beets were produced<sup>4</sup>." objectid="" width="100" centered=true %}
				
<p style="text-indent: 25px;"> For better or worse, staying together as a family in these conditions also meant working together as a family. Japanese Canadians of all ages and genders worked the beet farms, performing hard labour for long hours in order to scrape together enough money to live on. </p>

<p style="text-indent: 25px;">There are many stages to beet farming, each of which requires a significant amount of work. Activities that the correspondents mention having to carry out included planting, thinning, hoeing, and harvesting--which in and of itself has a variety of stages including pulling, piling, topping, and loading. </p>

{% include feature/blockquote.html text="To [top] this sugar beet we use a heavy knife with a curved hook at the end to pick it up. This we could only do about 1/2 acre a day or less. To every ton of beets topped we get $1.25 to 8 tons of beet topped and to anything over 8 tons an acre we get 1.00 per ton." author="Tad Nagamori" citation="Letter to Joan Gillis, October 4, 1942" %}

## Additional Sources of Work

<p style="text-indent: 25px;"> Often times, the pay of sugar beet farming was not enough. Family members had to find other ways to make ends meet within the restrictions placed upon their movement and labour by the Canadian government. For some, this involved doing other work for their “boss” or helping out on larger farms that were being worked by other families. Other times this involved finding other types of work. </p>

“Most of the Japanese sugar beet workers have now gone to the... work camp or to Ontario to cut pulp wood and few have landed swell jobs in Winnipeg.” Nagamori19430109-17

<p style="text-indent: 25px;">The types of work that Japanese Canadians could pick up greatly depended on their gender. Men tended to find work, as Jackie Takahashi did, in logging or other farming work, while women were more likely to doing house-work or to find factory or administrative work in towns or major cities.</p>

## Geography and Climate

<p style="text-indent: 25px;">Weather greatly affected when and how work was able to get done. Many of the letters describe conditions in which it was impossible to keep working because of inclement weather. Other times, even when families could work, they had to do so in extreme weather conditions.</p>
