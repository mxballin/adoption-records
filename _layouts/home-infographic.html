      <h1> Introduction </h1>
      <p style="text-indent: 25px;">Much of the impetus for this project comes from my own experience with my (lack of originating) records as an adoptee and a desire to explore them further now that I am a student of archival studies. I have certainly thought about and interacted with documentation of my adoption in the past, but now that I have a vocabulary with which to explain my interactions and reactions in a way that aligns them with other phenomena in the archival context, it seems like an exciting opportunity to be able to identify patterns across experiences and to suggest a framework through which archivists might help adoptees relate to and access their records, or even simply a new way for adoptees to understand their own relationships with their records as a community of shared experience.
      </p>
      <p>Through this project, I am interested in identifying the ways in which both existing and imagined records appear in or are absent from adoption narratives and examining how their presence/absence may hold space and influence an individualâ€™s construction of their identity and their personal story.      </p>
